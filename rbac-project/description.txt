🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – MERN Stack Project

This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
It provides a secure and fine-grained permission model that controls what users can do and see based on their roles — Admin, Editor, or Viewer.

The backend uses JWT authentication with encoded role claims and middleware-based authorization to protect APIs.
On the frontend, React dynamically enables, disables, or hides UI elements depending on the logged-in user’s permissions.

Admins can manage users and roles, Editors can create and modify their own content, and Viewers have read-only access.
MongoDB queries are filtered by role and ownership, ensuring data isolation and security at the database level.

This project also includes user seeding, Docker setup for quick deployment, and secure coding practices such as input validation, hashed passwords, CORS/CSRF protection, and role-based middleware testing.

🔑 Key Highlights

Fine-grained access control with Admin, Editor, and Viewer roles

JWT-based authentication and secure authorization middleware

Role & permission matrix for configurable access rules

UI guarding in React to restrict buttons, menus, and routes

Ownership checks ensuring Editors can only edit their own content

Admin panel for managing users and roles

Secure practices — password hashing, input sanitization, rate limiting

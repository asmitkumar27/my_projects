Description:

The Authentication and Authorization project focuses on implementing secure access control mechanisms within a web or mobile application. The main goal is to ensure that only verified users can access the system (Authentication) and that each user can only access the resources they are permitted to use (Authorization).

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user — for example, through a login system using username, email, password, or OTP.
Authorization, on the other hand, determines what actions or data a user can access after they are authenticated — for example, admin users having additional privileges compared to regular users.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of security concepts using technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Session Management, OAuth, or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It ensures data protection, user privacy, and secure communication between client and server.

Key Features:

Secure user registration and login system.

Password encryption using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, SHA).

Role-based access control (RBAC) for user permissions.

Session and token management using JWT or cookies.

Error handling and input validation for preventing unauthorized access.

Optional two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js

Backend: Node.js / Express / Django / Spring Boot

Database: MySQL / MongoDB / PostgreSQL

Security Tools: JWT, bcrypt, OAuth 2.0

Applications:

Secure login systems for web and mobile apps.

Online banking, e-commerce, and enterprise portals.

APIs and microservices requiring restricted access.

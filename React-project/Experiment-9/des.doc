Description:

The Cloud Deployment project focuses on deploying applications, websites, or services on a cloud platform to make them accessible over the internet. The main objective is to understand how to host, manage, and scale applications using cloud computing technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or IBM Cloud.

In this project, an application developed locally (such as a web app or backend API) is deployed to a cloud environment, where it can be accessed globally by users. The process involves setting up virtual servers, configuring storage and databases, using containerization (Docker), and managing resources efficiently through the cloud provider’s dashboard or command-line interface.

This project helps students learn about Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), along with concepts like scalability, availability, and security in cloud environments.

Key Features:

Deployment of a web or backend application to a cloud platform.

Use of virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions.

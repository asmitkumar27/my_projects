Defines a method displayInfo() that returns a string with basic details (Name and Age).

** Subclass: Student

Adds a new property: course.

Overrides the displayInfo() method to include both the base class details (via super.displayInfo()) and the student’s course.

** Subclass: Teacher

Adds a new property: subject.

Overrides the displayInfo() method to include the base class details and the teacher’s subject.

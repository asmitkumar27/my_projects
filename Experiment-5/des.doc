This project demonstrates how to create a Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown using JavaScript DOM Manipulation.

The webpage displays a list of products (like T-Shirt, Jeans, Smartphone, Novel, etc.), each belonging to a category such as Clothing, Electronics, or Books.

A dropdown menu is placed above the product list with options:

All (shows every product)

Clothing (shows only clothing items)

Electronics (shows only electronic items)

Books (shows only books)

Each product is assigned a custom data-category attribute to indicate which category it belongs to.

Using JavaScript event handling, the code listens for changes in the dropdown selection.

When the user selects a category, JavaScript filters the product list dynamically by showing only the matching products and hiding the rest.

If "All" is selected, all items are displayed again.

DOM Manipulation â†’ Using querySelectorAll to select elements and update their display.

Event Handling â†’ Listening for the change event on the dropdown menu.

Attributes â†’ Using data-category to classify products by type.

Real-time Filtering â†’ The page updates instantly without reloading.

âœ… Expected Output

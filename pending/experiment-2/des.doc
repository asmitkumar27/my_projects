Description:

The Responsive Banking UI project focuses on designing and developing a modern, user-friendly, and fully responsive interface for a digital banking system. The main goal of this project is to provide users with a seamless banking experience across all devices — desktop, tablet, and mobile — using clean design principles and responsive web technologies.

The interface allows users to interact with essential banking functionalities such as viewing account details, checking balances, transferring funds, viewing transaction history, and managing user profiles. The layout automatically adapts to different screen sizes and orientations to ensure consistent usability and accessibility.

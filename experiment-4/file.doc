The counter should:

Start at 0 when the textarea is empty.

Update instantly as the user types, pastes, or deletes text.

Work for multiple textareas independently (if more than one is added).

Pre-filled textareas should automatically show the correct initial character count on page load.

Expected Output

When the page loads:

An empty textarea shows Characters: 0.

A prefilled textarea (e.g., "Hello from ByteXL") shows Characters: 17.

As the user types:

Each keystroke immediately updates the counter.

Deleting characters reduces the count accordingly.

Multiple textareas (if present) maintain independent counters.

Layout remains clean and readable — the counter always stays below its textarea.

Pass Criteria

Counters update in real-time.

Prefilled text shows the correct count at load time.

Multiple counters work independently without interfering.

Layout and design stay consistent across different screen sizes.

Fail Criteria

Counter does not update when typing/deleting.

Incorrect count is displayed.

Counters overlap textareas or break the layout.

One textarea’s counter updates another’s.
